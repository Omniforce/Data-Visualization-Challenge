# Data-Visualization-Challenge

Frontend data visualization challenge from [Soofa](http://www.soofa.co/). We were challenged with creating an easily consumable interface that allows users to interact with data from both the [Active Food Establishment Licenses](http://dev.socrata.com/foundry/#/data.cityofboston.gov/fdxy-gydq) and the [Liquor Licenses](http://dev.socrata.com/foundry/#/data.cityofboston.gov/g9d9-7sj6) APIs. Our goal was to effectively tell a story of how both food and liquor licenses at establishments around Boston have changed over time. 

This application allows users to view all active food establishments in Boston, their addresses, when they got their food licenses, and if they have a liquor license. There are a few filter that allow you sort the data by date to determine if a resturant had either a food or a liquor license (or both) at a given time.
